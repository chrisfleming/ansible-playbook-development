GitHub Version Caching
----------------------

The software-local role fetches latest release versions from the GitHub API for
tools like ripgrep, fzf, neovim, etc. To avoid repeated API calls (and GitHub's
60 requests/hour rate limit for unauthenticated requests), versions are cached
in ~/.cache/ansible-versions/ for 24 hours.

On the first run, each tool queries GitHub and writes the version to a cache
file. Subsequent runs within 24 hours read from cache instead. After 24 hours
the cache is considered stale and GitHub is queried again.

To force a fresh lookup for a specific tool:

    rm ~/.cache/ansible-versions/ripgrep

To clear all cached versions:

    rm -rf ~/.cache/ansible-versions/
